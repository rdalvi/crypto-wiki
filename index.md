# Site Guide
## Overview

This site was written to be a guide to the cryptocurrency and blockchain landscape
for a 'regular person.' We presume no prior knowledge of blockchain or cryptocurrencies, and our goal
is to be able to get our readers to a baseline understanding of cryptocurrency assets and projects.
